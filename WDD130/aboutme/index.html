    <p>Hey Everyone! I am from St. Anthony, Idaho, and I've lived here just about my whole life. That one part of my life that I didn't live here was when I served a mission in Monterrey, Mexico. After I got back, I started school, got married a year and a half later, and now my wife and I have a toddler running around.</p>
    <p>I am a CIT Major, but I did just switch back over from the engineering program. I started school in CIT, switched to engineering for two years, and I have now switched back to CIT.</p>
    <p>One of the main advantages that I see from taking this class is the programming. Assuming that everyone in this class is in the Computer Science program, having any sort of training and education in programming and writing in computer languages is going to be very beneficial.</p>
    <p>With that said, I am very excited to be back in CIT and I'm excited to see what I learn in this class.</p>
